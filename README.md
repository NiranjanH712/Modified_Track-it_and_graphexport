Hi everyone, welcome to this repo!

This is mainly a way to store my modifications of an existing Bioinformati9cs computational MATLAB pipeline Track-it

This pipeline is used for looking at any molecules' (i.e. protein, a random elemental molecule )  specific property (i.e. jump angle/distance,intensity)

To read more, here is their repo and source code:https://gitlab.com/GebhardtLab/TrackIt.git

The original pipeline had some issues that I fixed with my modification, a major issue I fixed was OS compatability with the pipeline

Due to a particlar file in the pipeline I was not able to run the pipeline, to be more specific the file itself was created in a Windows based environment and (Visual Basic 2012)
hence it is only compatibvle with Windows OS version of MATLAB

I managed to circumvent this issue by rewriting the file's code through MATLAB directly.

I also had separate Graph export (MATLAB) and plotting (R) functions which I made as the graph generated by Track-it does not have the ideal format for the graph I wanted to generate

While this is technically done, I am working on some modifications that will make those functions more easier to use generally and not just for my particular project

I will update this file Once I upload this.
